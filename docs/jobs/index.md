_The DatagroveCR internship is currently limited to students who have been accepted to a university Computer Science program in Costa Rica._

## The Internship

**Full Stack Intern** - Hourly Pay :dollar:, Equipment :computer:, Learn to Code :mortar_board:

When in school we want your focus to be on learning everything you can, so you will work 8-10 flexible hours per week at the DatagroveCR office in Rohmoser for the internship. When your school is on break, come work with us 40 hours a week and write great software!

You will practice what you are learning in school building software for a better world. You will use Typescript, Go, Dart/Flutter, and Rust :crab:. Work on a team of interns where your input is welcome and needed. When you graduate, we hope you will stay!

You will also get practice with English, which for better or worse is the trade language of computer science. English is your most important computer language, and the one that requires the most practice :100:
