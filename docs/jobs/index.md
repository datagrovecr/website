## Full-Time Positions with Datagrove Costa Rica

DatagroveCR hires Costa Ricans who would like to pursue a career in software development as Junior Developers. Previous experience (self-taught or formal course work) with coding is preferred, but not required.  

You will work approximately 40 hours a week, primarily from our office in Rohmoser. Full-time employees receive a salary and are provided company equipment to use for coding work. Guidance, support, and community are provided, but the learning process will be highly self-directed. If that sounds exciting to you this opportunity might be a great fit!

## The DatgroveCR Internship Program

The DatagroveCR Internship Program hires university students studying computer science in Costa Rica as Trainee Developers. Beginners with a passion for coding are welcome!

When in school we want your focus to be on learning everything you can, so you will work 8-10 flexible hours per week at the DatagroveCR office in Rohmoser for the internship. When your school is on break, come work with us 40 hours a week and write great software!

You will practice what you are learning in school building software for a better world. You will work on a team of interns where your input is welcome and needed. When you graduate, we hope you will stay!

You will also get practice with English, which for better or worse is the trade language of computer science. English is your most important computer language, and the one that requires the most practice :100:
